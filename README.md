# README

This is a very simple MNIST CNN, which is widely used as the CNN architecture for beginners. I write this to reinforce my knowledge and learn Tensor Flow at the meanwhile. 

I write a very detailed notation in it, including what each row of codes is used for and some TF functions usually been used. So if you are a very first man in this field, I believe my code can be very useful to you.

There might be some bugs cause my laptop is not powerful enough to train it (T_T). So if you found something stupid, I will appreciate it and fix the bugs.
